# Natalio,Data Analysis & Visualization
This project explores insights from the Instagram account of Natalio, a clown character I created, who shares posts about mental health, relationships, and self-reflection. By combining my passions for illustration and data, I've used Python and various libraries to analyze and visualize data from Meta's insights on the account.


**Natalio** has gained significant interest on Instagram, and this project delves into the account’s reach and follower demographics. The analysis provides a deeper understanding of these key metrics. The data used in this analysis is current as of **August 15, 2024**, and covers **the past month** as provided by Meta’s insights.
